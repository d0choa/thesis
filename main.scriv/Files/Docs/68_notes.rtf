In this work we assess for the first time the effect of including predicted solvent accessibility information on the results and range of applicability of three co-evolution based methods for predicting protein interactions. \
We used a number of datasets representing different types of interactions (physical, functional, . . .) as gold standards in order to interpret the results in terms of the type of interaction of interest.\
