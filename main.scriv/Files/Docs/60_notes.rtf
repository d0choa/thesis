\f0\fs24 \cf0 An important improvement in the co-evolution-based detection of protein\'96protein interactions came from the assembly of genome-wide co-evolutionary networks from the pair-wise co-evolution of individual protein pairs\super 71\nosupersub . This approach, called ContextMirror, increases the accuracy of interaction predictions by correcting numerous problems related to the global tendencies of the data, including the background tree similarity due to speciation. Additionally, it is able to separate co-evolution that is specific to a given pair of proteins from general co-evolutionary trends involving many families concomitantly, as it evaluates pair-specific protein co-evolution by considering the contribution of every other protein tree. This disentanglement of direct and indirect correlations is closely related to the DCA-like methodologies of residue co-evolution, which were developed independently (see above).\
