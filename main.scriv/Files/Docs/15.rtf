\f0\fs28 \cf0 However, the many discrepancies between the interacting partners identified in high-throughput studies and those identified in small-scale experiments highlight the need for caution when interpreting results from high-throughput studies. These discrepancies also call for the development of computational methods of data validation. Even when interactions have been validated, one needs to be aware that, as was demonstrated recently by Edwards et al. [2\uc0\u56319 \u56320 ], the majority of the experimental evidence cannot distinguish between direct interactions and those mediated by at least one intermediate protein.\

These studies have been extremely valu- able toward our understanding of protein interaction networks, but they suffer from inherent experimental biases in terms of the types of interaction that can be detected. The first S. cerevisiae network, for example, was estimated to have a false-negative rate of 90% and a false-positive rate of 50% (von Mering et al. 2002; Sprinzak et al. 2003). Nevertheless, accuracy can be increased bycombining data sets (Bader and Hogue 2002; von Mering et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2008), by repeated screening (Venkatesan et al. 2009) and confidence evaluation (Yu et al. 2008; Braun et al. 2009), and by comparing data sets from different species (Kalaev et al. 2008).\
Complementary approaches based on experimental data as well as on sequence and evolutionary analyses are required in order to describe a system with a sufficient degree of detail so that it may effectively be understood.}
