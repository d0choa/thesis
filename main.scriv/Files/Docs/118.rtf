\f0\fs28 \cf0 The general observation that predicted accessibility only helps the PC and CM predictions in detecting binary physical interactions can be understood as an additional evidence in the co-adaptation *vs.* general co-evolution debate[#Pazos:2008bq].\
\
The fact that accessibility predictions worsens MT results suggests that the score of this methodology might be highly influenced by general non-specific co-evolutive processes. This general forces, which can produce similarities in evolutionary rates, would spread their signal through the whole sequences and not necessarily restricted to certain regions of exposed residues. This observation is supported by the fact that MT performances correlate positively with the number of positions used to generate the trees. On the other hand, the PC and CM methods benefit by the use of predicted accessibility when applied to the prediction of binary direct physical interactions. In these two methods, previously associated with a more specific co-evolution[#Juan:2008rz], the co-adaptative part of the co-evolutionary signal is probably higher. In the same line, the co-adaptative process is intuitively more expected in binary physical interactions where the role of compensatory changes is more critical than in partners without direct physical interaction.}
