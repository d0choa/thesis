Most biological processes can hardly be understood without a comprehensive analysis of a large number of molecular components and interactions. From the simplest systems to complex mammal machineries, the interactions between different molecules usually determines the resulting phenotype. This is the case with cellular proteins, which rarely work in isolation but are frequently involved in pathways and interaction networks. The eventual perturbation of these networks can lead to disease or even death. So, an elucidation of protein-protein interactions can greatly contribute to our understanding of living systems in general and pathological states in particular.\
