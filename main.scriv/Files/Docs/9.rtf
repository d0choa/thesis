The outcome of most biological processes can hardly be understood without the comprehensive analysis of large number of components and interactions. From the most simple systems in the minimal organisms to the mammal complex machineries, the relationship between different molecules usually determines the resulting phenotype. Focusing on cellular proteins, they rarely work in isolation but are frequently involved in pathways and interaction networks. The eventual perturbation of this networks normally implicates disease or even death, so an elucidation of protein-protein interactions can greatly contribute to our understanding of pathological states.\
