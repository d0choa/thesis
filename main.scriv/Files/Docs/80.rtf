\f0\fs28 \cf0 In order to perform a genome-wide accessibility prediction, it is necessary to compile the evolutionary information for each *E. coli* protein. Therefore, a list of candidate homolog sequences was retrieved searching with BLAST[#Altschul:1997tl] in the non-redundant Uniprot database[#TheUniProtConsortium:2007jj]. Sequences with an *E*-value \\\\(\\ge1\\times10^\{-4\}\\\\) or an identity \\\\(<20\\%\\\\) were not considered as potential homologs. Proteins with an alignment coverage lower than 60% (either respect to the hit or the query) were also excluded. Using all the remaining sequences, an MSA was generated for each *E. coli* protein using MUSCLE[#Edgar:2004yq]. Identities with the reference sequence were recalculated considering only those positions in the MSAs with less than 90% of gaps. Sequences with recalculated identities below 20% were also discarded. Additionally, sequence redundancy was removed at 95% to avoid overrepresentation of some sequences on accessibility prediction.\
\
Finally, these MSAs were used as input in the PROF program for predicting solvent accessibility[#Rost:1996cc]. The resulting scores obtained for every position in the MSA were mapped in the original *E. coli* protein for further analysis. For comparative purposes, equivalent accessibility analysis was performed with the alignments based on the same MSAs of orthologs used to generate the phylogenetic trees (more details in the next section).}
