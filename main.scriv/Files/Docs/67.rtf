\f0\fs28 \cf0 Considering the current state of the art in the computational prediction of protein-protein interactions, the motivation of this thesis is to contribute to the improvement of the so-called co-evolution-based methods. During the last decade, this family of techniques has demonstrated its ability to perform genome-wide protein interaction predictions even reaching accuracies similar to their experimental counterparts. However, many other limitations have appeared over the years, derived from technical issues or inherited from the lack of understanding of the underlying evolutionary process. Over the coming years, while the number of totally sequenced genomes increases, these problems may have a dramatic impact on the global prediction. Therefore, we propose a study of the area from different perspectives in order to broaden our understanding of the occurring mechanisms and provide solutions to some of the current hot topics.\
