\f0\fs28 \cf0 Considering the aforementioned limitations associated with the experimental identification of interacting partners (see [](#proteininteractiondatabases)), the computational techniques revealed in the last years as a powerful alternative to suggest and validate protein interactions. In particular, those methods based on coevolution at sequence level performed as the most promising ones, achieving genome-wide coverages and accuracies close to their experimental counterparts. However, some scientific and technical difficulties emerge as the factors influencing the coevolution of proteins remain unknown.\
