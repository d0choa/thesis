\f0\fs28 \cf0 The instability and heterogeneity of PPIs make their detection extremely sensible to the experimental setup. Therefore, a number of methods have been developed to screen interactions using different approaches at both, small and large scale.\
\
Traditionally, evidence is gathered using small scale experiments designed to identify and validate a small number of targeted interactions[#golemis2005protein]. Information defining protein interfaces at an atomic level can be provided by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. However, the number of solved protein complexes is still low[#Berman:2000hl]. Alternatively, several spectroscopic techniques characterize protein interactions in real-time using different labels[#LippincottSchwartz:2003fu,Piehler:2005ev]. For example, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) takes advantage of the modification in the spectral activity occurred when 2 fluorophores are close to each other[#Yan:2010fu]. Another method, known as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), has proven effective without spectroscopic labeling in detecting interactions between soluble ligands and immobilized receptors[#Karlsson:2004di,Cooper:2003bd]. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) allows to measure the enthalpy of binding[#VelazquezCampoy:2005ck]. Other methods, such as atomic force microscopy[#Yang:2003uk], can accurately analyze single molecules measuring the microscopic forces that bind the interacting proteins, or detecting conformational changes using fluorescence[#Margittai:2003ht].\
\
Nevertheless, during the last few years a set of high-throughput methodologies has emerged to exhaustively probe all the potential interactions within entire genomes. We will review some of the most used approaches, in order to understand their benefits and limitations.}
