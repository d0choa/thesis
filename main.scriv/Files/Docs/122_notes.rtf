\f0\fs26 \cf0 Problems evaluating\
In some cases it is difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to a given result, for example number of organisms vs. taxonomic criteria used for selecting them. Moreover, it is difficult to quantify and numerically assess the differences of the ROC curves we are using for evaluating performances. For that reason, these curves are evaluated qualitatively and the conclu- sions presented are based on general trends observed for many curves, instead of particular cases.
