Since the *tol-mirrortree*-like methods use information on the trees of 2 families as well as the species tree, this methodology has proven to be accurate in detecting non-standard evolutionary events as Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). The term HGT refers to the horizontal exchange of genes between distantly related strains or even species[#Brown:2003bd]. Previously described methods to detect HGT tried to infer the events from indirect evidences such as DNA composition bias[#Lawrence:2002tm,Nakamura:2004hb], abnormal sequence similarities between distant species [#Clarke:2002uu] or phylogenetic incongruence of gene tree[#Daubin:2003fr,Kunin:2003tb,Farahi:2003ts]. The *tol-mirrortree*-like family of methods provides another perspective, which implies the presence of at least a pair of proteins presenting the same anomaly.}
