Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are the result of a physical binding between two or more proteins to accomplish a biological function. They can be classified into different types depending on their strength (permanent and transient), specificity (specific or nonspecific), the location of interacting partners within one or on two polypeptide chains, and the similarity between interacting subunits (homo- and hetero-oligomers). Protein interactions are necessary to achieve many cellular processes related with functions as diverse as signaling, transport or catalysis. The perturbation of these interactions, in particular the distortion of protein interface, usually implies the development of many diseases.}
