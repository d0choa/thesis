\f0\fs28 \cf0 One of the most studied biological networks are those representing Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs). PPIs are the result of a physical binding between two or more proteins to accomplish a biological function. They can be classified into different categories depending on their strength (permanent and transient), specificity (specific or nonspecific) or the similarity between interacting subunits (homo- and hetero-oligomers). In the next sections, we will attend to another classification depending on the evidence reporting the interaction. We will distinguish between those cases in which the protein interaction is defined based on direct or indirect physical evidence, from those based broader functional relationships.\

Protein interactions are key in many cellular processes related with functions as diverse as signaling, transport or catalysis. The perturbation of these interactions, in particular the distortion of protein interface, usually implies the development of diseases and thus the great interest in identifying protein interactions.}
