\f0\fs28 \cf0 When the preprocessing of the uploaded data is finished, the user receives an email with the link to the results website. There, a number of links point to the intermediate files created during the preprocessing such as input files, BLAST outputs, MSAs or phylogenetic trees. Additionally, the user will find the MirrorTree Server UI. This tool post-processes the generated phylogenetic trees, estimates their similarity and plots both paired trees, allowing a more interactive insight into tree similarity.\
\
The distance matrices necessary to perform the tree-tree comparison are calculated by the UI adding the branch lengths that separate each pair of proteins in the tree. These distances, also known as \'93cophenetic distances\'94, are calculated only for those proteins encoded in genomes present in both trees. The tree similarities, as well as the statistical confidence, are calculated based on the standard [*mirrortree* algorithm](#mirrortree).}
