\f0\fs28 \cf0 Also known as Rosetta Stone, the approach is based on the observation that some interacting proteins have homologs in other genomes that are fused in one polypeptide chain[#Enright:1999dn][Marcotte:1999eu]. For instance, alpha and beta subunits of tryptophan synthetase are fused in fungi but exist as separate chains in bacteria[#Burns:1990wg]. Gene fusion apparently occurs to optimize co-regulation synching the relative concentration of both species. In fact, analysis of pairs predicted by this approach revealed that for more than half of the pairs both members were functionally related[#Marcotte:1999xe]. It has also been shown that the events are particularly more frequent in metabolic proteins[#Tsoka:2000fi]. \
\
The algorithms to detect such kind of events usually imply recursive sequence searches and multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). More recent modifications have included statistical measures to detect these *gene fusion* events focusing on all homologues rather than restricting the analysis to the orthologues[#Marcotte:2002ty].\
\
The main limitation of this methodology relies on the prevalence of fused proteins. Since the approach is restricted to shared domains in distinct proteins, what is the true extent of this phenomenon remains unclear[#Sprinzak:2001dc]. }
