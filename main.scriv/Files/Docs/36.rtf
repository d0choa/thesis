\f0\fs28 \cf0 Methods based on gene fusion events, an approach also known as \'93Rosetta Stone\'94, are based on the observation that some interacting proteins have homologs in other genomes that are fused in one polypeptide chain[#Enright:1999dn][Marcotte:1999eu]([](#computmethods.pdf)). For instance, the alpha and beta subunits of tryptophan synthetase are fused in fungi but exist as separate chains in bacteria[#Burns:1990wg]. Gene fusion apparently occurs to optimize co-regulation synching the relative concentration of both species. Analysis of pairs predicted by this approach revealed that for more than half of the pairs, both members were functionally related[#Marcotte:1999xe]. Gene fusion is particularly frequent in metabolic proteins[#Tsoka:2000fi]. \
\
The algorithms to detect such kind of events usually imply sequence searches and multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). More recent modifications have included statistical measures to detect *gene fusion* focusing on all homologs rather than restricting the analysis to the orthologs[#Marcotte:2002ty].\
\
The main limitation of this methodology lies on the prevalence of fused proteins. By definition, this approach is restricted to shared domains in distinct proteins, a phenomenon whose true extent is still unclear[#Sprinzak:2001dc], especially in prokaryotic organisms Moreover, the presence of promiscuous domains such as SH2 or SH3, invite to be cautious when applying this approach in an automatic way. }
