\f0\fs24 \cf0 In addition to the use of whole-protein sequences, phylogenetic trees derived from particular protein domains can be used to identify the interacting domains of two interacting proteins, on the basis that these domains exhibit stronger co-evolution signals than other non-interacting domains within the same proteins\super 78\nosupersub . Similarly, trees restricted to the interfaces showed that these co-evolve more intensely than the rest of the protein\super 79\nosupersub . Both of these observations indicate that in many cases the co-evolution between interacting proteins is a local phenomenon, which can be circumscribed to certain regions or even particular residues. This would be in line with the use of co-evolution signatures to identify interacting residues within proteins, as discussed earlier, and points to the possibility of using those co-evolutionary signatures at the residue level to look for protein\'96protein co-evolution (section \'93Convergence of residue- and protein-based methods\'94 below).}
