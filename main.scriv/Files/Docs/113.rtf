\f0\fs28 \cf0 The same way the matrix of pairwise *mirrortree* correlation coefficients has been used to predict single interactions, this contextual information was used to predict protein interactions based on *P*-values. Considering the sequenced Eubacteria and Archaea available in KEGG in 2010, we calculated the linear correlation coefficient (PC) obtained using coevolutionary profiles of correlation coefficients and coevolutionary profiles of the *P*-values calculated using *p-mirrortree*. We evaluated both predictions using the [\'93Complexes\'94 gold standard](#goldstandards) using [ROC analysis](#performanceevaluation).\

In order to reduce the number of false positives, we reassessed the similarity between a pair of co-evolutionary profiles by calculating their cophenetic distances when applying a hierarchal clustering over the whole list of co-evolutionary profiles. Distances between the different coevolutionary profiles were defined as 1 - PC score. Using these distances, different clustering algorithms were applied. These includes Ward\'92s minimum variance, complete linkage, neighbor-joining and UPGMA. Those coevolutionary profiles presenting lower distances in the resulting clustering are expected to present a closer pattern of similarities with the rest of the proteome. The accuracies of the top-scoring results were calculated and compared with those obtained from PC using either correlation coefficients or *P*-values as input.}
