\f0\fs28 \cf0 In this section, we introduce and evaluate a revisited version of the *P*-values associated to the correlation of distances in *mirrortree*-based approaches. In order to avoid some of the [problems affecting the current way of evaluating tree similarity](#openproblems), we designed a new methodology denominated *p-mirrortree*, in which the correlation significance is reassessed by comparing the observed correlation with a null distribution of correlations obtained from the similarities of a large set of permuted phylogenetic trees. Consequently, tree similarities are re-scored using a *P*-value which takes into account the dependencies present in the set of phylogenetic trees under study. To illustrate the problems associated to the previous versions of *mirrortree* and the improvement obtained by this new method, we compared the original and the new algorithm based on the \'93historical\'94 sets of organisms available. Finally, we evaluated the *p-mirrortree* ability to take advantage of the whole matrix of pairwise tree similarities, in a way similar to [PC method](#pc).}
