\f0\fs28 \cf0 In this section, we introduce and evaluate a revisited version of the *P*-values used in *mirrortree*-based approaches. In order to avoid the problems derived from the incomplete evolutionary model used in current *mirrortree*, we designed a new methodology denominated *p-mirrortree*, in which the correlation significance is reassessed by comparing the observed correlation with a null distribution of correlations created as consequence of comparing permuted phylogenetic trees. Consequently, protein pairs are re-scored using a biologically relevant *P*-value considering the dependencies present in the set of phylogenetic trees under study. In order to evaluate the ability of this new method to predict protein interactions, we compared the original and the new algorithm in the context of the available set of organisms in the period 2000-2010. In order to measure the robustness of both methods to the presence of redundant information, we also evaluated both approaches using a non-redundant set of organisms based in the same period. Finally, *p-mirrortree* ability to take advantage of the whole matrix of pairwise tree similarities was also evaluated. }
