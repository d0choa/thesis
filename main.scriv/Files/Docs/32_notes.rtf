\f0\fs24 \cf0 Interaction maps obtained for one species can be used to predict interaction networks in other species, to identify functions of unknown proteins, and to get insight into the evolution of protein interaction patterns. The interaction map analyses and comparisons are based on the observation that many interactions are conserved among species (\'91\'91interologs\'92\'92) [46]. Sequence-based searches for \'91\'91interologs\'92\'92 were able to identify 16%\'9631% of true \'91\'91interologs\'92\'92 (tested using Y2H system) even between remotely related species such as yeast and worm [96]. Analysis of conservation in the networks produced by gene co-expression data revealed that interologs correspond to the functionally related genes responsible for core biological processes [77]. Moreover, a multiple-species network has been constructed by identifying pairs of genes with correlated expression in different organisms. A multiple-species network has shown to perform better than a single-species network in linking together functionally related genes.\
