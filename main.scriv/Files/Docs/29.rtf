\f0\fs28 \cf0 There are different implementations of the phage display methodology as well as different applications[#Smith:1985hp]. One of the most common protocols uses the M13 filamentous phage. The DNA encoding the protein of interest is ligated into one of the coat proteins of the virion. Modified *Escherichia coli* strains are then transformed with the phage gene and the inserted DNA, whose products will not be released until the cells are infected with a helper phage. By immobilizing the other protein on the surface of a microtiter plate, a released phage displaying the partner protein remains, while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be eluted and used in an iterative process to enrich the sample with binding proteins. The high throughput implementation of phage display usually implies the usage of immobilized bait and a library consisting of all coding sequences in a cell or tissue. Normally, the process is followed by computational identification of potential interacting partners and a yeast two-hybrid validation step[#Tong:2002ec].}
