\f0\fs28 \cf0 In this study, we varied the set of organisms serving as reference to find ortholog sequences. We generated phylogenetic trees for every *E. coli* protein using the organisms in each of the 12 subsets. In order to do so, we look for protein orthologs in the corresponding list of sampled proteomes using the \'93BLAST best bi-directional hit\'94 criterion. Putative orthologs required an *E*-value of \\\\(\\le1\\times10^\{-5\}\\\\) and an alignment coverage of 70% to be considered for analysis. The set of resulting sequences are then aligned using MUSCLE[#Edgar:2004yq] with the default parameters. The phylogenetic trees are finally created by the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in ClustalW[#Larkin:2007hz], excluding the gaps for the distance calculations.\
