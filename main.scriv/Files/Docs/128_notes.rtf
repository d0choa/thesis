\f0\fs28 \cf0 Although many successful applications have been published over the years, little is known about the underlying evolutionary signal. Whether this similarity is due to compensatory changes or to similarities in the evolutionary rate, is a pivotal question that will condition future research on the issue. In this talk, we will cover most of the hot topics in this field, such as web interfaces, selection of reference taxa, structural implications, or selection of appropriate null models, among others.\

\f1\b\fs22 \cf0 Interacting or functionally related protein families tend to have similar phylogenetic trees. Based on this observation, techniques have been developed to predict interaction partners. The observed degree of similarity between the phylogenetic trees of two pro- teins is the result of many different factors besides the actual interaction or functional relationship between them. Such factors influence the performance of interaction predictions. One aspect that can influence this similarity is related to the fact that a given protein interacts with many others, and hence it must adapt to all of them. Accordingly, the interaction or coadaptation signal within its tree is a composite of the influence of all of the interactors. Here, we introduce a new estimator of coevolution to overcome this and other problems. Instead of relying on the individual value of tree similarity between two proteins, we use the whole network of similarities between all of the pairs of proteins within a genome to reassess the similarity of that pair, thereby taking into account its coevolutionary context. We show that this approach offers a substantial improvement in interaction prediction performance, providing a degree of accuracy/coverage comparable with, or in some cases better than, that of experimental techniques. More- over, important information on the structure, function, and evo- lution of macromolecular complexes can be inferred with this methodology.

A wide range of co\uc0\u8208 evolution\u8208 inspired computational methods has been designed to predict molecular interactions, but it is only recently that important advances have been made. Breakthroughs in the handling of phylogenetic information and in disentangling indirect relationships have resulted in an improved capacity to predict interactions between proteins and contacts between different protein residues. Here, we review the main co\u8208 evolution\u8208 based computational approaches, their theoretical basis, potential applications and foreseeable developments.
\fs24 \
Future advances in this field will require a better understanding of the molecular basis of the co-evolution of protein families. Thus, it will be important to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the similarity observed in phylogenetic trees of interacting proteins, distinguishing direct specific molecular inter- actions from other general functional constraints. In particular, it will be important to separate the effects of physical interactions within protein complexes (\'91co-adap- tation\'92) from other forces that, in a less specific way, can also create general patterns of co-evolution.\

Protein Kinases constitute a promising pharmaceutical target since they are involved in a large number of tumorigenic functions such as immune evasion, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, metas- tasis and angiogenesis. Although a small number of single-nucleotide kinase aberrations are causally associated with human diseases, most of the many protein kinase mutations published in the literature are tolerated and therefore, they are neutral in terms of protein and cell activity.
\fs24 \

\fs26 The mechanisms by which mutations elicit aberrant phenotypes have been studied and characterized in some relevant cases for which cause-e
\f3 \uc0\u8629 
\f2 ect relationships are now well under- stood. Nevertheless, the biochemical characterization of mutations cannot keep up with the pace of current high-throughput mutation discovery technologies, since the detailed study of each single mutation requires an enormous amount of e
\f3 \uc0\u8629 
\f2 ort, time and resources.
\fs24 \

\fs26 Thus, there is a clear need to broaden our understanding of mutations in the protein kinase superfamily and, in particular, the mechanisms by which these alter protein function and cause disease. This will help to develop cost-ecient protocols to identify, annotate, characterize and prioritize mutations, such that communal e
\f3 \uc0\u8629 
\f2 orts can focus on those most likely to play a direct role in human disease.
\fs24 \

\fs26 The aims of this thesis are to extend our understanding of the mechanisms by which pathogenic mutations disrupt the structure and function of protein kinases, and to design a reliable pipeline to identify mutations likely to be causally implicated in human disease. Focusing our e
\f3 \uc0\u8629 
\f2 orts on protein kinases makes possible the use of methods and ideas regarding their specific evolution and organization in protein families. This exclusive information can yield better results than those achieved by general-purpose methods.
\fs24 \

\fs26 Such challenging biological problems will be tackled in this doctoral thesis from the perspective of Computational Biology, a discipline that provides a powerful framework for the integrated analysis of complex information from multiple sources. Current advances in biostatistics and automatic machine learning technologies enable generalized rules to be established based on prior observation, which can then be used to assess the probability of newly discovered mutation being harmful.

\fs30 \cf0 Functional annotation is an open and interesting research topic in Molecular Biology. Determining a function in terminology terms is a hard task, due to lack of unified criterion and also because a function takes up many levels for the same protein. Given this difficulties, the way to determine a protein function is to annotate it with several terms from different vocabularies.
\fs24 \

\fs30 Proteins carry out their function together with other proteins, being part of protein complexes. These interactions are represented in a network of experimentally verified protein- protein interactions. Analyzing and using the interaction network is task of interest due to the great number of associations, and to the multiple ways in which a protein could influence in the function of others. Therefore, this thesis focuses in the prediction of functional annotation based on networks.
\fs24 \

\fs30 It\'92s apparent that this complex scenario couldn\'92t be faced without computational techniques. In fact, in Computational Biology, there is a considerable activity specially devoted to this topic. This thesis is part of this effort for applying computational methods to biological problems in the Systems Biology area. This approximation can belong to the Systems Biology context, because it does not analyze function in an isolated way for each molecule, but at system level, taking into account all the relations among genes and proteins linked at different levels. To take advantages of all these biological relations, and to preserve their structured semantics, this thesis suggests to use Relational Representation, since in particular it is suitable for the concerning domain. Over such representation, multiple transformations and Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to retrieve implicit knowledge from the related proteins, and to propose new functions through the prediction of functional associations between proteins.
\fs24 \

\fs30 The main proposal of this thesis is to characterize the function of proteins and genes based on networks, through Relational Representation and Machine Learning. Specially, from a relational representation specific to functional annotation, we look for the computational design needed to solve two specific, biological interesting and different problems. The former consists of predicting functional association between pair of proteins in 
\i E.coli
\i0 , and the latter comprises expanding pathways in humans. We perform an assessment in computational and biological interpretation terms. Besides, we propose new putative protein functional annotations to be experimentally verified. In addition, the thesis investigates diverse approaches to knowledge representation and learning techniques, suggesting specific strategies to tackle other biological problems, specially where relational data or multi-class and multi-label targets are present.
