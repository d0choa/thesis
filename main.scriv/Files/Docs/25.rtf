\f0\fs28 \cf0 Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP), usually combined with Mass Spectrometry (MS) techniques, is a powerful methodology to identify protein-protein interactions and, in particular, protein complexes. The TAP method involves the fusion of the target protein C-terminus with the TAP tag. This TAP Tag is a multi-domain chimeric protein containing calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) in the N-terminal, followed by the tobacco etch virus protease (TEV protease) cleavage site and Protein A, which binds tightly to IgG[#Rigaut:1999jv,Puig:2001hz]. The engineered protein is expressed in the host cell where it can form native complexes with other proteins.\
\
The target protein and the interacting proteins are isolated using a two step purification process. First, the protein tightly binds to beads coated with IgG; after washing out the contaminants, the TEV protease cuts the cleavage site. The elute of this first step is then adsorbed in calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. After washing, the target protein complex is released using ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA).\
\
The elution, containing the target protein and the interacting partners, is screened by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cleaved by proteases and the fragments identified by MS. The basis of MS is to produce ions that can be identified based on their mass-to-charge ratios[#Causier:2004cq,DiTullio:2005bu,Aebersold:2003fn]. MS works by ionizing the peptides to produce charged molecules in the gas phase that could be analyzed and detected using electromagnetic fields[#Whitehouse:1985tc,Pieles:1993vn,Karas:1988vn]. Different algorithms implement the identification of the resulting mass spectra[#Yates:1995ww,Taylor:1997iw,Pevzner:2000ed,Geer:2004kv]. Despite being able to find different variants of MS applied to the characterization of protein-protein interactions, purification of protein complexes still remains as the bottleneck of the process.}
