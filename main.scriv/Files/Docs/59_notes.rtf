\f0\fs24 \cf0 The application of MirrorTree-related methods benefits from a careful selection of the species used to construct the trees. Different criteria for the selection of species have been shown to influence the results, probably because of both taxonomic-specific biases and differences in the age of the co-evolutionary relationship are associated with different types of interactions\super 72\nosupersub . To circumvent these problems some methods automatically look for subsets of species in which co-evolution is particularly strong\super 73,74\nosupersub . }
