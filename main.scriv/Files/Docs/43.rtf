\f0\fs28 \cf0 Other methodologies include predictors based on training with the available information on proteins and interactions. The strength of these data-mining approaches is the integration of multiple information such as gene expression, experimentally determined protein interactions, protein localizations, protein phylogenetic profiles or similarity of phylogenetic trees[#Bock:2003vh,Yamanishi:2004bi,Martin:2005gs,Craig:2007gh,Craig:2007gn,Zaki:2009fe]. Although works using different algorithms and different organisms have been reported over the past few years, these methods suffer from the inherent problems derived from their primary data. Moreover, these methods are affected by the methodological problems of the experimental techniques, since they require previously described interactions in order to train reliable predictors.}
