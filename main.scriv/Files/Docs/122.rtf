\f0\fs28 \cf0 Alternatively to the low throughput analysis of protein-protein interactions, the *mirrortree* family of methods have shown particularly accurate predicting different types of interactions. Although our goal has been focused in the better understanding of the different phenomena rather than in method comparison, the results of the different *mirrortree* variants are in agreement with previous studies[#Juan:2008sf]. The lower MT performance compared with PC and CM had been previously reported but can better be understood at the light of these results. The naive design of MT reduces the coverage and ignores the phylogenetic biases introduced as consequence of the incomplete statistical model. This problems appear to be corrected by using pMT which obtain similar AUCs to the algorithms correcting this biases by using the genome-wide co-evolutionary networks such as PC, CM or the HCA. Despite of not overcoming pMT\'92s AUC, this family of context-based methods is particularly interesting to predict a few number of candidate interactions, since the number of false positives is considerably reduced. More interesting is the ability of HCA to inform about the structure of co-evolving protein complexes.\

Another general trend can be observed if we attend to the performance when the predictions are evaluated using different types of interactions. The fact that all methodologies render better results for interactions in the same macromolecular complexes had also been reported[#Juan:2008sf]. Wether this particularly good performance is consequence of biological reasons, such as the permanent and stable nature of the interactions between proteins within the same complex, or to technical artifacts, derived from the construction of the negative gold standard, remains unclear. On the other hand, the prediction of binary physical interactions, despite of not presenting high AUCs, benefits from the incorporation of more and more sequenced organisms to the co-evolution analysis. Moreover, our results indicate that the predictions of this type of interactions are improved by incorporating predicted structural features such as solvent accessibility. Finally, the prediction of interactions established as co-membership in the same metabolic pathway, in spite of being different from random, might not be of practical applicability. The explanation for the observed trends might be a consequence that evolutionary pressure for co-evolving is expected to be higher in proteins forced to interact permanently than in those with occasional associations.\

In the observed global performances it is difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to a given result. Therefore, the experimental setup need to be considered in order to extract general conclusions. Multiple causes can influence the coverage and AUC of a given prediction such as the number and distribution of organisms, the conservation of the pair of proteins, the type of interaction predicted or the scoring method, regardless of the problems derived of the results evaluation. Besides, the assessment must be considered in the context of application of a given technique. For example, if we are particularly interested in a small set of highly confident interaction candidates, evaluation using AUC may not be informative and hence alternative evaluations need to be considered such as precision-recall or evaluation of top scoring results.}
