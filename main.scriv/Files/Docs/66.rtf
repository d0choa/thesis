\f0\fs28 \cf0 Different approaches exist in order to asses the error in protein interaction data. The simplest approach when putative interacting pairs are detected is to measure its overlap with a gold standard reference set as an indicator of the true positive rate. Previous studies or protein interaction databases (see [](#proteininteractiondatabases)) are frequently used as gold standard[#vonMering:2002kg][Edwards:2002vt]. Another approach is to use the biological properties of candidate proteins such as protein function, localization and expression to asses how likely the interaction is to occur[#Deane:2002um][Schwikowski:2000bu][Saeed:2006bx][Deng:2003tv]. Indeed, some methods combined all this features in order to give a more confident estimator of the interaction reliability[#Bader:2004cl][Sharan:2005fp][Lin:2009ho]. In some other studies, interologs have been used for validation[#Deane:2002um][Saeed:2008hj]. Usually interologs are defined as predicted homologous interactions: if proteins *A* and *B* interact in species *S*, then proteins *A\'92* and *B\'92* in species *S\'92*, which are orthologs of A and B, are predicted to interact. The usage of interologs for validation have been matter of certain debate as physical interactions seems to be more conserved within species than across species[#Mika:2006gx]. Since all the protein interaction networks share the same topological features (see [](#biologicalnetworks)), methods based only on the characteristics of the resulting network have also been proposed for validation[#Saito:2002uy][Saito:2003wt][Chen:2006kc].\

These methods can also be applied to verify computational predictions. Since the computational methods usually provide a score of the interaction confidence, the predictions are usually validated using both a true positive and a true negative gold standard set in a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis[#Fawcett:2006gr][Jonsson:2006kl][Patil:2005kj]. The true positive sets can easily be obtained from manually curated databases, though some cautions are required on those organisms with low experimental coverage[#Saeed:2008hj]. On the other hand, a reference set of non-interacting proteins can be hard to define as the experimental data reporting non-interacting proteins is comparatively small[#BenHur:2006jv]. Recently a new database has begun to archive this data[#Smialowski:2010ei]. The usage of inappropriate or circular methodologies on prediction and assessment can produce biased results.}
