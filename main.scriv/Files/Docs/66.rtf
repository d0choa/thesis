\f0\fs28 \cf0 Different approaches exist for evaluating the results of a method to identify protein interactions, either experimentally or computationally. The simplest approach for evaluating a set of putative interactions is to measure its overlap with a gold standard reference set. Previous studies or [protein interaction databases](#proteininteractiondatabases) are frequently used as gold standard[#vonMering:2002kg,Edwards:2002vt]. Another approach is to use the biological properties of candidate proteins such as protein function, localization or expression to assess how likely the interaction is to occur[#Deane:2002um,Schwikowski:2000bu,Saeed:2006bx,Deng:2003tv]. Indeed, some methods combined all these features in order to give a more confident predictor of the interaction reliability[#Bader:2004cl,Sharan:2005fp,Lin:2009ho]. In some other studies, interologs have been used for validation[#Deane:2002um,Saeed:2008hj]. Usually interologs are defined as  homologous interactions: if proteins A and B interact in species S, then proteins A\'92 and B\'92 in species S\'92, which are orthologs of A and B, are predicted to interact. The usage of interologs for validation have been a matter of certain debate as physical interactions seem to be more conserved within species than across species[#Mika:2006gx]. Since all the protein interaction networks share the same [topological features](#biologicalnetworks), methods based only on the characteristics of the resulting network have also been proposed for validation[#Saito:2002uy,Saito:2003wt,Chen:2006kc].\

The computational methods, contrary to their experimental counterparts, provide a score associated with the interaction confidence. Thus, the ranked lists of candidate interactions are usually validated using both, a positive and a negative gold standard set. One of the most common approaches is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis[#Fawcett:2006gr,Jonsson:2006kl,Patil:2005kj]. The true positive sets necessary to run this analysis can easily be obtained from manually curated databases, though some cautions are required in those organisms with low experimental coverage[#Saeed:2008hj]. However, a negative reference set can be hard to define as the experimental data reporting non-interacting proteins is comparatively small[#BenHur:2006jv]. Recently, a new database has begun to archive this data[#Smialowski:2010ei].\
