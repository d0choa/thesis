\f0\fs28 \cf0 Protein microarrays or protein chips are frequently used to detect interactions but also to determine their function especially in large scale experiments[#MacBeath:2000uk][Zhu:2001de][Jones:2006ji]. The chip consists in a support surface where an array of proteins are immobilized. Probe molecules labelled with fluorescent dyes are then added to the platform. After washing the surface, any specific interactions can be detected through the detection of fluorescent signal by a laser scanner. The main advantage of this technology is the ability to test large number of molecules in the same experiment. Unfortunately, and contrary to what happens with DNA microarrays, the stability of the proteins is very sensible to their environment so the performance of the platform decreases as soon as the conditions are not controlled.}
