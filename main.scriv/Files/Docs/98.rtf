\f0\fs28 \cf0 The original [*mirrortree*](#mt) and [*p-mirrortree*](#pmirrortree) were applied to each of the [\'93historical\'94 sets of distance matrices](#yearbasedmatrixes). The matrices contained the distances between the protein sequences belonging to the available organisms over the years, considering two different redundancy criteria. For the *p-mirrortree*, we executed the algorithm creating a maximum of 40 intervals of number of organisms in common, and ran 1.000 permutation steps with a branch-switch probability of 0.05 ([](#pmirrortree)). Both methods produced lists of putative interacting pairs ranked by their corresponding scores, correlation coefficient or *P*-value, respectively. Those pairs whose proteins are present in the same KO group were excluded to avoid artifacts caused by extremely similar trees.\
\
In order to compare the performances within the same year (redundant/non-redundant and *mirrortree*/*p-mirrortree*), only those protein pairs present in the four results lists were considered, limiting the evaluation to the discriminant capacity of the scores. The resulting ranked lists were evaluated in the context of [ROC analysis](#performanceevaluation) using the [three types of reference interaction sets previously described](#goldstandards). Complementary evaluations were performed using only the pairs of trees with at least 15 and 30 organisms in common.}
