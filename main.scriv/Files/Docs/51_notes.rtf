\f0\fs24 \cf0 Munich MPact/MIPS database. MPact is a resource to access MIPS, which contains a manually curated yeast protein interaction dataset [97] collected by curators from the literature. The resource also includes high-throughput results for yeast, but keeps this data separate. MIPS is often used as a standard of truth database for evaluating the quality of data and the accuracy of interaction prediction methods.\
