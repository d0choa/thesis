\f0\fs28 \cf0 Synthetic lethality is a very common type of *in vivo* genetic screening which tries to understand the mechanisms that allows phenotypic stability despite genetic variation, environmental changes and random events such as mutations. This methodology produces mutations or deletions in two or more genes which are viable alone but cause lethality when combined together under certain conditions[#Rutherford:2000hg][Hartman:2001ty][Bender:1991vh][Ooi:2006gp][Brown:2006ft]. A screening of this genetic dependencies can point to possible physical interactions between proteins, their participation in the same biochemical process or a similar function.}
