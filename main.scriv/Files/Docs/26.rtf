\f0\fs28 \cf0 Synthetic lethality is a very common type of *in vivo* genetic screening which tries to understand the mechanisms that allows phenotypic stability despite genetic variation, environmental changes and random events such as mutations. This methodology produce mutations or deletions in two or more genes which are viable alone but cause lethality when combined together under certain conditions[#Rutherford:2000hg][Hartman:2001ty][Bender:1991vh][Ooi:2006gp][Brown:2006ft]. A screening of these genetic dependencies can point to possible physical interactions between proteins, their participation in the same biochemical process or a similar function. Compared with the results obtained in aforementioned methodologies, the relationships detected by synthetic lethality not necessary requires the physical interaction between the proteins. Therefore, we refer to this type of relationships as functional interactions.   }
