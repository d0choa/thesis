\f0\fs28 \cf0 For each [phylogenetic tree generated based on the available genomes in 2011](#treespvalues), a matrix of cophenetic distances was calculated by summing the lengths of the branches separating each pair of proteins. Depending on the grade of conservation of the protein family, the size of these squared matrices range from 3 rows/columns to the number of organisms in the reference set. Those rows/columns containing information referring to the organisms available in each of the [redundant or non-redundant sets in the period 2000-2010](#yearorgselection), were considered in order to arrange year-based distance matrixes. For comparative purposes, MSAs are not recalculated, so distances between a particular pair of sequences in a given protein family remain constant independently of the set of organisms used as reference. As a result, for each of the protein families in the *E. coli* genome, year-based distance matrixes were generated, using redundant or non-redundant organisms.\
