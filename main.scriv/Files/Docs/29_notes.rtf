\f0\fs26 \cf0 Like the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hybrid_system"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 two-hybrid system}}, phage display is used for the high-throughput screening of protein interactions. In the case of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M13_bacteriophage"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 M13 filamentous phage}} display, the DNA encoding the protein or peptide of interest is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_ligase"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 ligated}} into the pIII or pVIII gene, encoding either the minor or major {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_protein"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 coat protein}}, respectively. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_cloning_site"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Multiple cloning sites}} are sometimes used to ensure that the fragments are inserted in all three possible {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frames"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 reading frames}} so that the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDNA"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 cDNA}} fragment is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_translation"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 translated}} in the proper frame. The phage gene and insert {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_hybridization"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 DNA hybrid}} is then inserted (a process known as "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 transformation}}") into {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf2 Escherichia coli}} (E. coli) bacterial cells such as TG1, SS320, ER2738, or XL1-Blue 
\i E. coli
\i0 . If a "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagemid"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 phagemid}}" {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(molecular_biology)"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 vector}} is used (a simplified display construct vector) {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 phage particles}} will not be released from the 
\i E. coli
\i0  cells until they are infected with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helper_virus"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 helper phage}}, which enables packaging of the phage DNA and assembly of the mature {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 virions}} with the relevant protein fragment as part of their outer coat on either the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat protein. By immobilizing a relevant DNA or protein target(s) to the surface of a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtiter_plate"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 microtiter plate}} well, a phage that displays a protein that binds to one of those targets on its surface will remain while others are removed by washing. Those that remain can be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elution"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 eluted}}, used to produce more phage (by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 bacterial}} infection with helper phage) and so produce a phage mixture that is enriched with relevant (i.e. binding) phage. The repeated cycling of these steps is referred to as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopanning"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 'panning'}}, in reference to the enrichment of a sample of gold by removing undesirable materials. Phage eluted in the final step can be used to infect a suitable bacterial host, from which the phagemids can be collected and the relevant DNA sequence excised and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 sequenced}} to identify the relevant, interacting proteins or protein fragments.\

Applications of phage display technology include determination of interaction partners of a protein (which would be used as the immobilised phage "bait" with a DNA library consisting of all {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 coding sequences}} of a cell, tissue or organism) so that the function or the mechanism of the function of that protein may be determined.

\fs26 \cf0  Phage display is also a widely used method for 
\i in vitro
\i0  protein evolution (also called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_engineering"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 protein engineering}}). As such, phage display is a useful tool in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 drug discovery}}. It is used for finding new {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 ligands}} (enzyme inhibitors, receptor agonists and antagonists) to target proteins.
\fs22 \cf2 [8][9][10]
\fs26 \cf0  The technique is also used to determine {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumour"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 tumour}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigens"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 antigens}} (for use in diagnosis and therapeutic targeting)
\fs22 \cf2 [11]
\fs26 \cf0  and in searching for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-DNA_interaction"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 protein-DNA interactions}}
\fs22 \cf2 [12]
\fs26 \cf0  using specially-constructed DNA libraries with randomised segments.\
The invention of antibody phage display by laboratories at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC_Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology}} led by Greg Winter and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCafferty"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 John McCafferty}} and at The Scripps Research Institute led by Richard Lerner and Carlos F. Barbas revolutionised antibody drug discovery.
\fs22 \cf2 [13][14]
\fs26 \cf0  In 1991, The Scripps group reported the first display and selection of human antibodies on phage.
\fs22 \cf2 [15]
\fs26 \cf0  This initial study described the rapid isolation of human antibody {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_antigen-binding"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Fab}} that bound {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus_toxin"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 tetanus toxin}} and the method was then extended to rapidly clone human anti-HIV-1 antibodies for vaccine design and therapy.

Phage display of antibody libraries has become a powerful method for both studying the immune response as well as a method to rapidly select and evolve human antibodies for therapy. Antibody phage display was later used by Carlos F. Barbas at The Scripps Research Institute to create the first synthetic human antibody libraries, thereby allowing human antibodies to be created in vitro from synthetic diversity elements.

Antibody libraries displaying millions of different antibodies on phage are often used in the pharmaceutical industry to isolate highly specific therapeutic antibody leads, for development into antibody drugs primarily as anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory therapeutics. One of the most successful was HUMIRA ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 adalimumab}}), discovered by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Antibody_Technology"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Cambridge Antibody Technology}} as D2E7 and developed and marketed by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Abbott Laboratories}}. HUMIRA, an antibody to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_alpha"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 TNF alpha}}, was the world's first fully human antibody,
\fs22 \cf2 [25]
\fs26 \cf0  which achieved annual sales exceeding $1bn.
