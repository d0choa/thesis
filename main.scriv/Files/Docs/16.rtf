The Systems Biology relies on the study of mentioned complex interactions within biological systems. Contrary to the more traditional reductionism, this discipline approaches the biological problems from a holistic point of view. Indeed, the reductionism  has been extremely successful explaining many areas of the Biology but, for many reasons, the integration of data is necessary to solve problems that can not be understand as the sum of the parts.\
\
The change in the paradigm together with different high-throughput technics give birth to what is known as the Omics era. Genomics, Proteomics or Metabolomics are just a few of the many research areas emerged during the last decade producing massive amounts of data. Therefore, new methodologies and infrastructures previously applied to other scientific areas appeared to solve biomedical problems. One of this new areas is the study of biological networks.\
