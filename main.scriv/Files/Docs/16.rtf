\f0\fs28 \cf0 Systems Biology relies on the study of the aforementioned complex interactions within biological systems. Contrary to more traditional reductionism, this discipline approaches biological problems from a holistic point of view. Indeed, reductionism has been extremely successful explaining many areas of Biology but, for many reasons, the integration of data is necessary to solve problems that cannot be understood as the sum of the parts.\
\
This change in the paradigm, together with different high-throughput techniques, give birth to what is known as the -Omics era. Genomics, Proteomics or Metabolomics are just a few of the many research areas emerged over the last decade producing massive amounts of data. As a result, new methodologies and infrastructures previously applied to other scientific areas have appeared in order to solve biomedical problems. One of these new areas is the study of biological networks.\
