\f0\fs28 \cf0 Systems Biology relies on the study of the aforementioned complex networks of interactions within biological systems[#Kitano:2002cw][Nurse:2003jc]. Contrary to more traditional reductionism, which tries to understand biological problems dividing the systems on their constituent parts, Systems Biology approaches these problems from a holistic point of view. Indeed, reductionism has been extremely successful explaining many areas of Biology but, for many reasons, the integration of data is necessary to solve problems that cannot be understood as the sum of the parts. This change in the paradigm, together with the massive amount of data produced as consequence of what is known as the -Omics era, supposed a revolution in the study of biological systems, especially during the last 15 years. As a result, new methodologies and infrastructures previously applied to other scientific areas are now applied to solve biomedical problems. One of these new areas is the study of biological networks.\
