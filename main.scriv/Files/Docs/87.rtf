\f0\fs28 \cf0 Pairwise distances between all the orthologs in the each of the phylogenetic trees were calculated for the 6 different sets. These distances were calculated by adding the lengths of the branches separating the corresponding leaves. These distance matrices served as input for three *mirrortree*-based approaches.\
\
Using the distance matrices, the original [*mirrortree*](#mirrortree) was applied for protein pairwise comparison in all the accessibility filtered sets. Only the pairs of phylogenetic trees with, at least, 15 species in common and a tabulated *P*-value \\\\(\\le1\\times10^\{-5\}\\\\) associated to the correlations were considered. The *mirrortree* correlation coefficients fulfilling the aforementioned conditions were used as input in the [Profile-correlation methodology](#profile-correlation). The same thresholds of 15 species and *P*-value \\\\(\\le1\\times10^\{-5\}\\\\) were applied in PC. Finally, we used the [Context-Mirror algorithm](#context-mirror) applied over the co-evolutionary profiles,  to predict protein-interactions using different levels of specificity.\
\
The performance of the three methods when fed with phylogenetic trees generated with residues of different predicted accessibility was evaluated using [ROC analysis](#performanceevaluation), [using three datasets representing protein interactions of different nature](#goldstandards).}
