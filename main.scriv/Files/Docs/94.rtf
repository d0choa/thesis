\f0\fs28 \cf0 Using the completely sequenced Eubacteria and Archaea present in the KEGG database (release 59.0 - August 2011)[#Kanehisa:2004fr], we created phylogenetic trees for all *E. coli* proteins. Prokaryotic protein families with both paralogs and orthologs were retrieved for each protein using KEGG orthology groups (KO). In order to select a single ortholog for each organism, we selected the sequences, which were best ranked against the corresponding *E. Coli* protein on the pre-calculated lists of \'93BLAST best bi-directional hits\'94 stored in KEGG. The resulting protein families were then aligned by MUSCLE[#Edgar:2004yq] using the default parameters. For each one of the 2,844 MSAs, a phylogenetic tree was created using the neighbor-joining algorithm implemented in TreeBeST[#Vilella:2009ju].}
