\f0\fs28 \cf0 The described limitations of the experimental technics call for the development of new approaches to predict wether two proteins interact. The interacting partners usually share some structural, physico-chemical or evolutionary constraints as consequence of their interaction. Therefore, several computational algorithms raised based on different descriptors in order to predict interactions at small or large scale. While some methods are based on structural features of the candidates, others may take advantage of the increasing genomic information available[#Shoemaker:2007gg]. The latter, known as *genome context* methods, can provide additional evidences on candidate interactions, as well as some insight on evolutionary events governing them.}
