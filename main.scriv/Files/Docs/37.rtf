\f0\fs28 \cf0 Functionally related genes, which encode potentially interacting proteins, are frequently transcribed together as: operons in bacteria and co-regulated clusters in eukaryotes. Gene neighbor methods apply these adjacency relationships as a proxy to infer interacting proteins ([](#computmethods.pdf)). Despite the gene shuffling produced as an effect of neutral evolution, gene order is usually conserved resulting in gene clusters and operons[#Dandekar:1998rw,Overbeek:1999rc]. By using this neighborhood information, functional interactions were predicted with higher coverage (about 37%) and precision (63-75%) than prior genomic inference methods[#Huynen:2000fv]. To some extent, this approach can be applied to eukaryotes, in which interacting co-regulated genes are often found to cluster in the genome[#Teichmann:2004cz].\

Successful examples of gene neighborhood have been reported. By comparing gene order in archeal and eukaryotic genomes, the exosome superoperon suggested a functional and possibly a physical interaction between two subunits of RNase P and the postulated archaeal exosome, a connection that had not been reported in eukaryotes[#Koonin:2001hu]. This novel linkage was validated experimentally in supplementary studies[#EvguenievaHackenberg:2003kl].  }
