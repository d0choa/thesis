\f0\fs28 \cf0 Functionally related genes encoding for potentially interacting proteins are frequently transcribed together as a simple unit, operons in bacteria and co-regulated clusters in eukaryotes. Gene neighbor methods use these adjacency relationships as a proxy to infer interacting proteins. Despite the effect of neutral evolution which tends to shuffle genes, gene order is usually conserved in gene clusters and operons[#Dandekar:1998rw][Overbeek:1999rc] and predicts functional interactions with higher coverage (about 37%) and precision (63-75%) than prior genomic inference methods[#Huynen:2000fv]. To some extent, this approach can be applied to eukaryotes in which interacting co-regulated genes are often found to cluster in the genome[#Teichmann:2004cz].\
\
Successful examples of gene neighborhood have been reported. By comparing gene order in archeal and eukaryotic genomes, exosome superoperon revealed the interaction with two subunits of RNase P, a linkage validated experimentally that was not reported earlier [#Koonin:2001hu][EvguenievaHackenberg:2003kl].  \
