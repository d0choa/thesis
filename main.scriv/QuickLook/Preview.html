<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>The outcome of most biological processes can hardly be understood without the comprehensive analysis of large number of components and interactions. From the most simple systems in the minimal organisms to the mammal complex machineries, the relationship between different molecules usually determines the resulting phenotype. Focusing on cellular proteins, they rarely work in isolation but are frequently involved in pathways and interaction networks. The eventual perturbation of this networks nor...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Systems Biology and Protein-Protein Interactions</strong><br/>The Systems Biology relies on the study of mentioned complex interactions within biological systems. Contrary to the more traditional reductionism, this discipline approaches the biological problems from a holistic point of view. Indeed, the reductionism  has been extremely successful explaining many areas of the Biology, but for many reasons, the integration of data is necessary to solve problems that can not be understand as the sum of the parts.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Biological Networks</strong><br/>The study of interactions between the components of biological systems and how these interactions give rise the function and behaviour of the system has been frequently modelled using networks. Many systems take the form of networks <br/>

The molecular entities are usually represented as nodes connected by edges representing different kinds of relationships. Under this schema, multiple kinds of biological systems has been represented: food webs, gene-regulatory networks or protein-protein interactio...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Types of interactions</strong><br/>Protein interactions can be classified into different types depending on their strength (permanent and transient), specificity (specific or nonspecific), the location of interacting partners within one or on two polypeptide chains, and the similarity between interacting subunits (homo- and hetero-oligomers)</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>High throughput studies</strong><br/>Large protein–protein interaction networks are commonly obtained from high-throughput experiments. Such large-scale efforts have described the interaction maps for organisms such as Helicobacter pylori (Rain et al. 2001), Escherichia coli (Butland et al. 2005), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ito et al. 2000; Schwikowski et al. 2000; Uetz et al. 2000; Gavin et al. 2002; Ho et al. 2002), Caeno- rhabditis elegans (Walhout et al. 2000; Simonis et al. 2009), Dro- sophila melanogaster (Giot et al. 2003), a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Problems on experimental technics</strong><br/>However, the many discrepancies between the interacting partners identified in high-throughput studies and those identified in small-scale experiments highlight the need for caution when interpreting results from high-throughput studies. These discrepancies also call for the development of computational methods of data validation. Even when interactions have been validated, one needs to be aware that, as was demonstrated recently by Edwards et al. [2􏰀], the majority of the experimental evidence...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>introducing</strong><br/>The European languages [#Ochoa:2013jf] are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages co...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>PPIs as networks</strong><br/>Cellular proteins rarely work in isolation, but are more usually involved in pathways and interaction networks. Dysfunctional networks are commonly implicated in disease, so an elucidation of protein–protein interactions can greatly contribute to our un- derstanding of pathological states, and much more broadly, of molecular biology. </p>
