<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/><br/>
The outcome of most biological processes can hardly be understood without the comprehensive analysis of large number of components and interactions. From the most simple systems in the minimal organisms to the mammal complex machineries, the relationship between different molecules usually determines the resulting phenotype. Focusing on cellular proteins, they rarely work in isolation but are frequently involved in pathways and interaction networks. The eventual perturbation of this networks no...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Systems Biology and Protein-Protein Interactions</strong><br/><br/>
The Systems Biology relies on the study of mentioned complex interactions within biological systems. Contrary to the more traditional reductionism, this discipline approaches the biological problems from a holistic point of view. Indeed, the reductionism  has been extremely successful explaining many areas of the Biology but, for many reasons, the integration of data is necessary to solve problems that can not be understand as the sum of the parts.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Biological Networks</strong><br/><br/>
The study of interactions between the components of biological systems and how these interactions give rise the function and behavior of that process has been frequently modeled using networks[#Strogatz:2001fp]. Many systems take the form of networks when the entities are represented as nodes and their relationships as the connecting edges. This schema previously applied to social networks[#Wasserman:1994tg][Scott:2000wq][Watts:1998pd], food webs[#Williams:2000jc] or the World Wide Web[#Broder:...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Protein-Protein Interactions</strong><br/><br/>
Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are the result of a physical binding between two or more proteins to accomplish a biological function. They can be classified into different types depending on their strength (permanent and transient), specificity (specific or nonspecific), the location of interacting partners within one or on two polypeptide chains, and the similarity between interacting subunits (homo- and hetero-oligomers). Protein interactions are necessary to achieve many cellular proces...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Experimental Determination of PPIs</strong><br/><br/>
The instability and heterogeneity of PPIs make their detection extremely sensible to the experimental setup. Different methods raised to screen interactions in order to capture their heterogenous nature.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, evidences are gathered using small scale experiments designed to identify and validate a small number of targeted interactions[#golemis2005protein].  Information defining protein interfaces at atomic level can be provided by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. However, t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Yeast two-hybrid</strong><br/><br/>
One of the most successful techniques accelerating the screening of interactions *in vivo* is the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) methodology. Y2H takes advantage of the fact that eukaryotic transcription activators have at least two different domains, one that binds to the DNA promoter (BD) and another that activates the transcription (AD). It was reported how the transcription can be disrupted by splitting the activator in their two constituent domains, whereas the activity can be restored if a DNA-bi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Affinity purification/mass spectrometric identification</strong><br/>Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) usually combined with Mass Spectrometry (MS) technics is a powerful methodology to identify protein-protein interactions and especially protein complexes. The TAP method involves the fusion of the target protein C-terminus with the TAP tag. This TAP Tag is a multi-domain chimeric protein containing calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) in the N-terminal, followed by the tobacco etch virus protease (TEV protease) cleavage site and Protein A which binds tightly with I...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Synthetic lethality</strong><br/>Synthetic lethality is a very common type of *in vivo* genetic screening which tries to understand the mechanisms that allows phenotypic stability despite genetic variation, environmental changes and random events such as mutations. This methodology produces mutations or deletions in two or more genes which are viable alone but cause lethality when combined together under certain conditions[#Rutherford:2000hg][Hartman:2001ty][Bender:1991vh][Ooi:2006gp][Brown:2006ft]. A screening of this genetic ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Protein chips</strong><br/>Protein microarrays or protein chips are frequently used to detect interactions but also to determine their function especially in large scale experiments[#MacBeath:2000uk][Zhu:2001de][Jones:2006ji]. The chip consists in a support surface where an array of proteins are immobilized. Probe molecules labelled with fluorescent dyes are then added to the platform. After washing the surface, any specific interactions can be detected through the detection of fluorescent signal by a laser scanner. The m...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Phage display</strong><br/>The are different implementations of the phage display methodology as well as different applications[#Smith:1985hp].  One of the most commons protocols uses the M13 filamentous phage. The DNA encoding the protein of interest is ligated into one of coat proteins of the virion. Modified *Escherichia coli* strains are then transformed with the phage gene and the inserted DNA which products will not be released until the cells are infected with a helper phage. By immobilizing the target protein to t...</p>
