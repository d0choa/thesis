<p class="binderItem"><strong>PPIs as networks</strong><br/>Cellular proteins rarely work in isolation, but are more usually involved in pathways and interaction networks. Dysfunctional networks are commonly implicated in disease, so an elucidation of protein–protein interactions can greatly contribute to our un- derstanding of pathological states, and much more broadly, of molecular biology. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Types of interactions</strong><br/>Protein interactions can be classified into different types depending on their strength (permanent and transient), specificity (specific or nonspecific), the location of interacting partners within one or on two polypeptide chains, and the similarity between interacting subunits (homo- and hetero-oligomers)<br/>
<br/>
Systems biology relies on accurate representa- tions of interaction networks, but these are often hard to describe. Interactions can be conditional or contextual, and may not always be captu...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>High throughput studies</strong><br/>Large protein–protein interaction networks are commonly obtained from high-throughput experiments. Such large-scale efforts have described the interaction maps for organisms such as Helicobacter pylori (Rain et al. 2001), Escherichia coli (Butland et al. 2005), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ito et al. 2000; Schwikowski et al. 2000; Uetz et al. 2000; Gavin et al. 2002; Ho et al. 2002), Caeno- rhabditis elegans (Walhout et al. 2000; Simonis et al. 2009), Dro- sophila melanogaster (Giot et al. 2003), a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Problems on experimental technics</strong><br/>However, the many discrepancies between the interacting partners identified in high-throughput studies and those identified in small-scale experiments highlight the need for caution when interpreting results from high-throughput studies. These discrepancies also call for the development of computational methods of data validation. Even when interactions have been validated, one needs to be aware that, as was demonstrated recently by Edwards et al. [2􏰀], the majority of the experimental evidence...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>introducing</strong><br/>The European languages [#Ochoa:2013jf] are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages co...</p>
